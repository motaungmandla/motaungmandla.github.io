# Professional Portfolio

Student | Aspiring Cybersecurity & ML Engineer | Building AI for Low-Resource Communities

I’m a B.Sc. Mathematics and Computer Science student at the National University of Lesotho, where I lead machine learning and AI initiatives focused on solving local challenges — from speech recognition in Sesotho to community-driven tech projects.

💡 Currently building a low-resource, offline-capable speech-to-text system for Sesotho, using Whisper fine-tuning and NLLB translation models — all optimized for Raspberry Pi deployment in rural classrooms and clinics.

🔧 Skilled in Python, PyTorch, Flutter, Linux, and ethical hacking (CISCO certified). I’ve designed firmware for weather sensor networks, led student tech teams, and built tools that bridge digital divides — because technology should serve everyone, not just those with high-end devices or internet access.

🌍 Passionate about human-centered AI, cybersecurity, and open-source collaboration. Open to research, internships, or partnerships — especially if you’re working on inclusive tech, African languages, or edge AI.

👉 Let’s connect if you’re building something meaningful — or if you want to talk about how to make AI work where it’s needed most.
