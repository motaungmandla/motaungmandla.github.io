Overview

The Math Chatbot is a context-aware conversational assistant designed to help users solve mathematical problems using natural language input. It integrates with SymPy , a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics, to provide accurate and detailed solutions to algebraic, calculus, discrete math, and more complex problems.

The bot is ideal for students, educators, and professionals who want to:

Solve equations step-by-step
Understand how to simplify expressions
Learn basic to advanced math concepts interactively
It supports both English and Sesotho (optional), making it accessible to local learners in Lesotho.

Features
‚úÖ Natural Language Input
Users can type questions like "Solve 2x + 5 = 10" or "Integrate x^2 from 0 to 3"

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Explanations
Instead of just giving the final answer, the chatbot explains each step clearly.

‚úÖ Context-Aware Responses
Maintains conversation context to support follow-up questions like "Now differentiate that function"

‚úÖ Supports Multiple Math Domains

Algebra
Calculus
Linear Algebra
Discrete Math
Statistics
‚úÖ Easy Integration
Built with Python, Flask, and SymPy ‚Äî ready to deploy on web or mobile platforms

üß© Future Enhancements
Add voice recognition and text-to-speech for accessibility
Support for multiple languages (e.g., Sesotho, Zulu)
Mobile app integration using Kivy
Add LaTeX rendering for better equation display
Build a training module for high school students
